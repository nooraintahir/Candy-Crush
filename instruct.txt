
INSTRUCTIONS:

The goal of the game is to reach the target score in a set number of moves.

Click two candies to swap them.

If the swap creates a row or column of three or more adjacent candies you
get points.

1 point for hexagon, 2 points for teardrop, 3 points for 
squares, 4 points for diamond.

A donut will be made once a combo of 5 similar candies is made.

If you swap a donut with any candy, it destroys all the candies of 
that color on the board.

GOOD LUCK!
